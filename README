HoverEdit is a jQuery Plugin by Michael Ruoss

JQuery plugin for on-hover form elements. Your form elements will be displayed
as normal text until the user hovers with the mouse over them. On mouse over,
the actual form element gets visible and the normal text disappears.

After changing the value in the form element, press enter, tab or just
klick somewhere outside the field to trigger the save callback function
which has to be provided by the caller.
Pressing ESCAPE will cancel the modification.

Use class 'input-required' to force non-empty input validation.

Events:
  The plugins defines and triggers custom events on the form element:
  error.input-required: Is triggered if the user tries to empty a
                        required field. The caller of the plugin has
                        to handle errors e.g. display an error message.

Example:
  HTML:
    <input type="text" name="first_name" class="hover-edit input-required"/>

  Javascript:
    jQuery('.hover-edit').hoveredit({
        saveCallback: function(wrapper, form_element, old_value){ do some ajax here and then call this.hoveredit('success') or this.hoveredit('cancel')};
    });
